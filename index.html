                        <p>I like to code games, mainly in C++, but this time, I used Python for the speed of development and ease of use. I use python, C, C#, C++, and Java. I also know html, css, and Javascript. For animations and art, I use blender and krita

                        <p>Hi ! I've been coding for about 2 years now. Whether it be games, learning new thinking processes, or just for fun, coding is always fun (other than when there's a bug). I mainly code in Python, though I would like to continue learning new languages like C++. As the developper of this website, I also know a little HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

                        <p>Hello, I'm Troy. I made the music and most of the sound effects for the game using bandlab. I started my music journey about 7 years ago but am getting into digital music more recently. I've worked on a couple different sound tracks but these are the first ones "published" to society.</p>

                        <p>Hello, I'm Justin. I started coding about 5 years ago, and I still do it to today. I've made multiple games over python, p5js, and other languages. P.S. - I main coding in scratch, and I will continue arguing it should count as a language</p>
